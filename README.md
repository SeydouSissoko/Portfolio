Hi! I’m Seydou Sissoko, a senior Cybersecurity major at Kennesaw State University (B.S., expected May 2027). I’m passionate about cloud security, Identity & Access Management (IAM), and security engineering. I enjoy building secure systems, automating security workflows, and analyzing logs to detect and respond to threats.
